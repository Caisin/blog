#### Definition of financial statements.
Financial statements report information on a business’s financial activities. These statements include details on the company’s financial results, financial conditions, and cash flows. Financial statements are typically issued quarterly or annually.

#### The purpose of financial statements. 
Details about a company’s financial performance are reported in its financial statements. Financial statements provide crucial information for owners and managers to make business decisions. Investors use financial statements to assess the benefits and risks of investing in a company. 

-The aim of a financial statements is to provide information about **a company’s performance.** 

Details about a company’s financial performance are reported in its financial statements. Financial statements report information on a business’s financial activities. 
#### The three main types of financial statements. 
The three main financial statements are the balance sheet, the income statements, and the cash flow statement. A balance sheet displays the financial position of a company at a certain time. An income statements shows the financial performance of a company over a specific period. A cash flow statements provide a record of the cash coming in and going out of a company. 

**The relationship between the financial statements.** All three financial statements are interrelated and complementary. Companies make a **balance sheet** at the beginning and end of an accounting period. The **income statement** shows the changes from the beginning to the end of an accounting period. A **cash flow statement** gives a summary of the cash and cash equivalents moving in and out of a company. Together, the three types of financial statements can provide a complete picture of a company’s financial situation. 

The **income statement** shows the changes from the beginning to the end of an accounting period. 

>### Balance sheet
#### Balance sheet.
The balance sheet shows what a company owns, what it owes, and what it’s worth. A balance sheet has three sections. On the left side of a balance sheet is a company’s assets. A company’s equity, also referred to as owner’s equity or shareholder’s equity, is listed on the right side. A company’s liabilities are listed below equity. **The company’s total assets are equal to its liabilities plus equity.** Therefore, the two sides of the balance sheet are equal. 

#### Assets
The assets side of the balance sheet lists the total value of the company’s resources. Here we find such items as cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and the other resources. The corporation reported total assets worth 70 million dollars on its balance sheet. 

**Assets are equal to liabilities plus equity.**

A company’s total assets are equal to its liabilities plus equity. Unsold goods and materials are accounted for as assets in the balance sheet. If a customer hasn’t paid the money for the goods or services within an agreed time frame, it should be listed as accounts receivable. 

**On a balance sheet, a company’s inventories are considered as assets.** 

#### Liabilities.
Liabilities are the obligations or financial debts a company owes. Each form of liabilities usually has the word “payable” in its account title. One common liability is accounts payable, which comes from buying goods or services on credit. Another example of liability is notes payable, which commonly comes in the form of a bank loan. Other forms of liabilities include wages payable, income taxes payable, and so on. 

#### Owner’s equity.
The part of a business that belongs to the owners is called owner’s equity. Owner’s equity reflects the amount the owner has invested in a company and the amount  they have retained from its profits. Two common ways to increase owner’s equity are receiving more investments or increasing profits. 

-If a company takes on debt, it will increase its liabilities. 

-the profits an owner has retained from their company.

The company hired many new staff but had not yet paid their wages, which increased the company’s listed liabilities. The company has several liabilities valued at two million dollars. If a real estate company has $500,000 in assets and $400,000 in liabilities, its equity is $100,000. 

#### Income Statement

Income statement. An income statement shows changes in a business’s revenues and expenses over a certain time period. Items included in an income statement are revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, expenses, and net profit. 

#### Revenue.
Revenue is the income that a business receives. Revenue is usually generated from the sale of goods and services. A company’s performance is measured based on how its revenue compares with its expenses. 

#### Cost of goods sold. 
Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost that comes from the production of goods. This includes the cost of materials and direct labor costs used to produce the goods. For a bakery, the money spent on buying flour is considered as cost of goods sold. 

-Two items included in an income statement are revenue and expenses. 

-by selling goods and services.

The newspaper industry has struggled in recent years to boost its revenue. Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and direct labor costs and excludes distribution costs and other indirect expenses. A company’s total costs are equal to the cost of goods sold plus expenses. The mobile industry’s revenue is projected to reach over 1 trillion dollars in 2020. 

Cost of goods sold includes materials costs and labor. 

#### Gross profit.
Gross profit is the total profit made after deducting the cost of goods sold from sales. A company can increase its gross profit by increasing sales while maintaining or reducing cost of goods sold. 

#### Expenses. 
Expenses represent the amount of money a business spends besides the cost of goods sold. Common business expenses include employee wages, payment to suppliers, and office leases. Businesses try to cut expenses in order to increase their net profit. 

#### Net profit. 
Net profit is the profit a company makes after subtracting expenses from its gross profit. Companies can determine if they are successful or not by looking at their net profit. 

Gross profit can increase by increasing sales while maintaining or reducing cost of goods sold.

gross profits minus expenses.

Our gross profit for the quarter amounted to 7 million dollars. A start-up company may need to borrow a large sum of money to pay for its expenses. Annual net profit dropped 15% due to increased expenses. If their sales had not declined so significantly, their net profit wouldn’t have decreased. The firm’s net profit was 4 million dollars for the first quarter, while its gross profit was 30 million dollars. Because their cost of goods sold increased more than their revenue, their gross profit decreased. 

>### Cash Flow Statement

Cash flow statement. A cash flow statement shows the amount of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving a company. A cash flow stamen is divided into three parts: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. 

#### Operating activities.
A business’s operating activities directly relate to providing goods and services to the market. These activities include manufacturing, distributing, and selling products or services. Cash receipts from goods sold and payments to suppliers are common operating activities in a cash flow statement. 

-A cash flow statement shows the amount of cash entering and leaving a company. 

Cash and cash equivalents calculate assets that are cash or can be converted into cash. A clothing store’s operating activities may include buying materials and paying for labor to produce clothing. 

A cash flow statement shows the amount of cash entering and leaving a company. 

#### Investing activities.
Investing activities are directly related to changes resulting from investments. The sale of fixed assets and the collection of loans are examples of positive cash flow from investing activities. Negative cash flow from investing activities may come from purchasing fixed assets and lending money. 

#### Financing activities.
Cash flow from financing activities measures cash flow between a firm and its owners and creditors. It indicates how a company raises cash. Financing activities that bring a positive cash flow include receiving cash from issuing stocks and bonds. Financing activities that bring a negative cash flow include paying off debt, interest on debt, and dividends to shareholders. 

-The sale of fixed assets and the collection of loans are examples of positive cash flow from investing activities. 

-The movement of cash between a company and its owners is cash flow from financing activities. 

They had a negative cash flow from investing activities because they lent a large sum of money. Rather than being an indication of poor performance, negative cash flows may simply be due to heavy expenditures. 

They had a negative cash flow from investing activities because they lent a lot of money. Investing activities include sources and uses of cash from investments. 

>### Company Finances

Student: Hey, professor Buron. My name is Lucy. This morning, you mentioned that the company Nick Spade is on the verge of bankruptcy. If you have time, could I just discuss the situation with you more? 

Professor: Of course Lucy. What do you want to know? 

Student: Well, I’m curious about how a company this famous could suddenly be in red. 

Professor: Well, Nick Spade has been declining for a long time, but its last financial quarter was especially bad. Their store sales dropped by 11%. For a global company like Nick Spade it was 60 million dollars. 

Student: Wa! If their sales have fallen so much, it must have hurt their net profits. 

Professor: It has. Nick Spade’s loss for last quarter was around 150 million dollars. Same quarter last it was only 7 million dollars. 

Student: Why are they having so much trouble though? Several years ago they were doing well, weren’t they? 

Professor: Well, Retail has changed a lot over the last few years, and Nick Spade didn’t anticipate the changes. More shopper has been buying cheaper fast faction. But Nick Spade kept its prices high. Their biggest mistake, though, was that they didn’t anticipate the rise of online shopping. Online shopping has become extremely popular. But Nick Spade has focused on building physical stores. 

Student: So now they’ll have to close more stores? 

Professor: Right. But even then Nick Spade has still in trouble. To build their stores, they had taken out a loan of over a billion dollars in debt, which will be due in three years. And judging for their current financial statements they won’t be able to pay it back. 

Student: What will happen if they can’t pay it back? 

Professor: They may try to restructure the company by selling off assets, cutting jobs, and closing stores. Restructuring would help them pay back the debt. But to do that they has to get an extinction on their debt payment. In the worst-case scenario, they will have to file for bankruptcy. 

Student: Thanks for explaining it to me. I hope Nick Spade can stay around longer. I really like their clothes. 

Professor: My daughter does too. But markets are cruel. What’s more, their upper management has been replaced, and so have their senior designers. No matter what happens, it will probably be a very different company.
